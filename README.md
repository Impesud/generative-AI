# Generative AI
Generative AI refers to a field of artificial intelligence focused on creating data, such as images, texts, or even music, that mimics or resembles human-generated content. It operates using various techniques like neural networks to generate new, original content by learning patterns and structures from existing data. This technology has applications in diverse areas, from creating lifelike images to generating text, and it continually evolves to produce more sophisticated and convincing outputs.

Here you will find our projects developed in Generative AI.
